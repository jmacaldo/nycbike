##### A web app that searches public records in  NYC's Open Data portal for ticketed traffic violations :cop:

**Check out the live demo here :point_right: https://nycbike.herokuapp.com/**

This project is a React/Redux application built on top of Node.Js. Simply enter a license plate and vehicle's state of registration, and returned (if it exists) is a list of all traffic violations and its fines associated with that plate.
